# WMFPrep
WMFPrep is a toolbox for functional magnetic resonance imaging preprocessing (fMRI) within brain white-matter (WM), which analysis brain WM function in an easy, flexible and quick manner.

# Software dependencies
Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/);
Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (RESTplus, http://www.restfMRI.net/forum/restplus). 
This toolbox works on MATLAB 2014a and higher, including Windows (8, 10 and Server versions), and Linux (Ubuntu and CentOS) in 64-bit versions.
